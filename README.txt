Human action recognition is a crucial task within the field of computer vision, with wide-ranging applications across domains such as surveillance, robotics, human-computer interaction, and healthcare. Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable success in this area. In this project, we set out to explore and assess the effectiveness of three prominent CNN architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, and VGG19, in the context of recognizing human actions from images.


Objectives:


- Evaluate the performance of VGG16, ResNet50, and VGG19 architectures for human action recognition.
- Investigate different strategies, including transfer learning, fine-tuning, and adaptive learning rates, for improving model accuracy.
- Conduct a series of six experiments using these approaches to compare their effectiveness in terms of accuracy and loss on the human action recognition task.
- Provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of transfer learning, fine-tuning, and adaptive learning rates for each CNN architecture.
- Contribute to the selection of the most suitable model and approach for human action recognition tasks.
